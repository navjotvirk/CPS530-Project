      <h2>What is Polymer Project 2.0 </h2>
      <p>Polymer is a JavaScript library that helps users create custom reusable HTML elements. Polymer adds additional functionality over standard Web
        Component API’s resulting in performance oriented and maintainable apps. </p>
        <p><strong>Unlock the Power of Web Components.</strong> <br>
          Polymer Project 2.0 is a lightweight library that focuses on taking full advantage of Web Components. </p>

          <h2>How are Web Components utilized? </h2>
          <p>Web Components helps developers create reusable custom elements that interoperate seamlessly with the browser’s built-in elements, or break
            your app up into right-sized components, making your code cleaner and less expensive to maintain. </p>

          <div class="card">
            <h2>How popular is Polymer Project 2.0? </h2>
            <p>Polymer.js is one of the most upcoming high-in-demand web technologies being developed by Google developers and contributors on GitHub.
              Polymer Project recently released version 2.0 building on its popularity and improving interoperability and data system improvements. </p>
              <p>Polymer 2.0 is based on web platform standards that are natively supported on over 1 billion mobile devices. </p>

              <h2>What are the strengths of Polymer Project 2.0? </h2>
              <p><strong>Speed Focused </strong><br>
                Polymers platform does the heavy lifting resulting in responsive apps. </p>
                <p><strong>For today and beyond </strong><br>
                  Polymer makes the most of the web platform by using the latest APIs. </p>
                  <p><strong>Fully Interoperable </strong><br>
                    Polymer-powered elements are based on standard Web Components APIs, so they work seamlessly with the browser's built-in elements and other
                    Web Components. </p>

                  <div class="card">
                    <h2>What are the weaknesses of Polymer Project 2.0? </h2>
                    <p>- It is not entirely clear that how to organize larger applications. </p>
                    <p>- Dependency errors and pointing to a different version of dependencies. </p>
                    <p>- Downloading of entire library and Polyfills. </p>
                    <p>- Lack of server side rendering. </p>
                  </div>

                  <div class="card">
                    <h2>What are Polyfills? </h2>
                    <p>For backing Web Components, we always need Polyfills. The webcomponent.js Polyfills enables the Web Components in browsers that lack
                      native support. </p>
                    </div>

                      <h2>Which developers mostly use it and for what kind of websites? </h2>
                      <p>Primarily, developers with a focus on speed utilize this framework. Developers that use Polymer 2.0 have the ability to create web applications
                        without worrying about cross browser compatibility problems. </p>
                        <p>Google is using Polymer for a wide variety of their services such as YouTube Web, Google Earth, Google Music, Project Fi, Chrome Components:
                          PDF Viewer, OS Keyboard, Feature Dashboard. <br>
                          Other companies that utilize Polymer include EA, McDonald’s Menu Board Software, Bloomberg. </p>

                          <h2>Is Polymer Project 2.0 backend, frontend or both? </h2>
                          <p>Polymer Project 2.0 is a front end library, as it provides access to Web Components APIs. The Polymer strategy is to have front-end developers 
                            leverage browser based technologies which are currently in the process of standardization, as they become available. In the meantime, gaps are
                            filled using Polyfills. </p>
