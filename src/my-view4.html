      <h1>Experience with Polymer/Firebase</h1>
      <p>Overall, Polymer is a robust and modular Framework that is very capable of handling making a professional and responsive website for a plethora of devices.</p>
  	  <p>Firebase was very to implement, using our already made google accounts we simply took our finalized project and pushed it to Firebase.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="card">
  	  <h1>Installation and Configuration</h1>
  	  <p>Polymer was easy to set up but hard to implement due to its lack of documentation. Some of the installation for our team proved to be a challenge, but there were available workarounds available.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="card">
  	  <h1>Setting up the page</h1>
  	  <p>Setting up the main page for Polymer was a fairly streamlined process. Following a demo was given to us by Polymer, which then we modified and adapted to our specific needs.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="card">
  	  <h1>Learning curve VS. HTML/CSS</h1>
  	  <p>Although Polymer has a lot of different features to access, we found that the lack of documentation was the main issue in developing our demo and main page.  Compared to pure HTML or CSS, Polymer has a much steeper learning curve. In the future, if the documentation improves we can see this being a powerful tool for web development.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="card">
  	  <h1>Looking Back</h1>
  	  <p>Given the chance to start over, we conclude that we should have read through the documentation given to us more carefully before attempting different aspects of the project.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="card">
  	  <h1>Would we change our framework/CMS</h1>
  	  <p>Although we ended up growing accustomed to Polymer if given the opportunity to do so we would have liked to experience different frameworks to play around with.</p>
      </div>
