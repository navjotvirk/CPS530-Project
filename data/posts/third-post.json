  "body_text": "Born in Alabama and initially studying art in New York City, in 1867, Bridgman moved to Parstudy under the noted academic painter Jean-Leon Gerome (1824-1904)\nHe was deeply influenced by Gerome's precise draftsmanship, smooth finishes, and concern for Middle-Eastern themes\nLater, Bridgeman would be known as the American GeromeÓ while emphasizing bright colors, painterly brushwork, and a more atmospheric landscape\nHe found success and popularity among collectors in the US and Europe winning the Cross of the Legion dÕHonneur in 1877\nBridgman made his first trip to North Africa between 1872 and 1874, dividing his time between Algeria and Egypt\nThere he executed approximately three hundred sketches, which became the source material for several later oil paintings\nAdditional visits to the region throughout the 1870s and 1880s allowed him to amass a collection of costumes, architectural pieces, and objets d'art, which often appear in his paintings\nAmusingly, John Singer Sargent noted that Bridgman's overstuffed studio, along with the Eiffel Tower, were Paris's must-see attractions\n"
